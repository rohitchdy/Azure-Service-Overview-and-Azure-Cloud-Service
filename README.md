## Azure Services Overview for Beginners

![Azure Services Diagram](UploadedImage1.jpg)

This image is a schematic representation of an Azure Services Overview, specifically designed for beginners. It outlines various components and services offered by Azure that work together to deliver web content and applications. The diagram is divided into two main sections: Private Network and Public Network.

## Private Network

1. **Web Server (IIS/ASP.NET/HTML5/CSS3)**
   - This server handles web requests and serves web pages to users. It uses technologies like IIS (Internet Information Services), ASP.NET, HTML5, and CSS3.

2. **App Server (WCF/Web API/SignalR)**
   - The application server processes business logic and handles communication between the web server and the database. It uses technologies like WCF (Windows Communication Foundation), Web API, and SignalR.

3. **DB Cache**
   - This component stores frequently accessed data to improve performance and reduce the load on the database.

4. **Database (DB)**
   - The database stores all the application data. It includes both RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) and NoSQL databases.

5. **Messaging Queue/Notifications**
   - This component handles asynchronous communication and notifications between different parts of the system.

6. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - This dashboard provides real-time monitoring and analytics of the system's performance and health.

## Public Network

1. **DNS Zone**
   - The DNS zone manages the domain names and translates them into IP addresses.

2. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**
   - The CDN distributes content to users from the nearest server location to reduce latency and improve load times.

3. **External Storage for Images/Videos/Music**
   - This storage solution handles large files like images, videos, and music, ensuring they are accessible and scalable.

4. **Hadoop Data Analytics Platform**
   - Hadoop is used for big data processing and analytics.

5. **Data Warehouse**
   - The data warehouse stores large volumes of structured data for analysis and reporting.

6. **Business Intelligence**
   - This component provides tools and services for data analysis, reporting, and visualization.

## Client Access

- **Mobile App/Browser**
  - Users can access the services through mobile apps or web browsers.

- **External Desktop/Laptop/Mobile**
  - External clients can also access the services from various devices like desktops, laptops, and mobile phones.

## Data Flow

- Arrows in the diagram indicate the flow of data between different components, such as from the Load Balancer to the Web Server or from the CDN to External Storage.

## Clean Architecture

- The diagram also represents a clean architecture within the system, ensuring that each component is modular and can be independently managed and scaled.
